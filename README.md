# Intro-to-Comp-Ling-Final
Final Project for Intro to Computational Linguistics Fall 2019

For this project, I transcribed twenty minutes of standup comedy from comedians Dave Chappelle and Lewis Black. I had the idea that, the more plosive (specifically the /k/) and 'oo' (like goose) sounds a comedian used, the funnier that comedian would be. Details, research, and conclusions are in the writeup.
