# Intro-to-Comp-Ling-Final
Final Project for Intro to Computational Linguistics Fall 2019

For this project, I transcribed twenty minutes of standup comedy from comedians Dave Chappelle and Lewis Black. I did a sentiment analysis on the data and a count of certain sounds each comedian used. This is based on ideas that, the more negative a comedian is, and the more of certain types of sounds (think 'k' like 'clock'), the funnier that comedian would be. Details + results are in the writeup.
